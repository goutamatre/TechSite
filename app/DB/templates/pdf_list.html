<!-- This template displays a list of uploaded PDF files with options to view or download each file. -->
<!-- The files are passed to the template from the Flask route, and each file has a unique ID for viewing and downloading. -->
<!-- The template uses Jinja2 syntax to loop through the files and display their names and actions. -->
<!-- The links for viewing and downloading the files point to specific routes in the Flask application, which handle the respective actions. -->
<!-- The template is simple and straightforward, focusing on functionality rather than design. -->
<!-- The use of an unordered list makes it easy to read and navigate through the available PDFs. -->
